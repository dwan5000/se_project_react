# WTWR

What To Wear - A weather-based clothing reccommendation app

## Description

The What to Wear App is a dynamic app that reccommends pieces of clothing based on the weather in your area. The app displays the clothing items in cards throughout the app; while also displaying your location, date, and weather. Each card can be clicked on get a closer look on the card; also there is a delete button each card just in case a user wants to get rid of a piece of clothing indefinitely. There is also a unique toggle switch to switch the unit of measure from celcius to farenheit. There is also a add clothes button that allows the user to add and import their own images of clothing and name it. The app also has a /profile page by clicking on the avatar or username where the user can access all of the clothing available in its database. WTWR solves a unique problem by automatically reccommending what clothes that would make sense to wear by calculating to temperature outside and giving a selection based on the temperature. It utilizes the GET, POST, and DELETE APIs to send its request to servers so it will save whenever a action is performed.
